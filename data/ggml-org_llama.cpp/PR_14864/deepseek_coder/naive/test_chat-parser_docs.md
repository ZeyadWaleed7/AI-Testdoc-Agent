## Test File Documentation: test_chat-parser

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `ChatParser` class. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `ChatParser` class is able to correctly parse and interpret chat messages. The main functionality is to validate the `parseMessage` method, which is expected to correctly interpret and parse chat messages.

## Individual Test Functions

### `TestSuccess`
- Function name: `TestSuccess`
- Signature: `void TestSuccess()`
- Purpose: Validate the `parseMessage` method with a valid chat message.
- Input parameters: A valid chat message.
- Expected outcomes: The `ChatParser` should be able to correctly interpret and parse the chat message.
- Assertions: The `parseMessage` method should return a `std::optional<Message>` object. If the message is valid, the object should contain a `Message` object.
- Setup: No setup required.

### `TestFailure`
- Function name: `TestFailure`
- Signature: `void TestFailure()`
- Purpose: Validate the `parseMessage` method with an invalid chat message.
- Input parameters: An invalid chat message.
- Expected outcomes: The `ChatParser` should not be able to correctly interpret and parse the chat message.
- Assertions: The `parseMessage` method should return an empty `std::optional<Message>` object.
- Setup: No setup required.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy is to cover both happy path and edge cases. Happy path tests are validating the `parseMessage` method with valid chat messages. Edge cases are validating the `parseMessage` method with invalid chat messages. The coverage of the test is to ensure that all possible scenarios are covered.

The validation is based on the `ChatParser` class's functionality and features. The `parseMessage` method is expected to correctly interpret and parse chat messages.

The system being tested is the `ChatParser` class. The test framework is `gtest`.

## Technical Details
- Required imports: `ChatParser`, `Message`, `std::optional`, `std::string`, `std::vector`.
- Test framework: `gtest`.
- Mock objects: No mock objects are needed.
- Test data: No test data is used.

## Running and Debugging
To run the tests, use the command `make test`. Prerequisites are no specific setup required. Debugging failures can be done by adding `-g` flag to the gtest command. Common issues and solutions include ensuring all imports are correctly included and the test framework is correctly set up.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code is organized in a modular and clean manner. The `ChatParser` class is divided into several test-friendly modules. The `parseMessage` method is the only public method of the `ChatParser` class. The test-friendly modules are `ChatParserTest` and `ChatParser`. The test-friendly modules are organized in a way that they are independent of the public interface.
