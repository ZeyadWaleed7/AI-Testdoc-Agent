## Test File Documentation: test_common

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the common functions in the common module. The common module is a part of the larger system and contains functions that are used across multiple modules. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that these functions work correctly and that they behave as expected under different scenarios. The tests are designed to cover a wide range of scenarios, including happy path, edge cases, and errors.

## Individual Test Functions

### Test Function 1: test_addition
- Function name and signature: `test_addition()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: To ensure that the addition function works correctly.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two integers, both positive and negative.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The function should return the sum of the two input integers.
- Any mocking or setup required: None.

### Test Function 2: test_subtraction
- Function name and signature: `test_subtraction()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: To ensure that the subtraction function works correctly.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two integers, both positive and negative.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The function should return the difference between the two input integers.
- Any mocking or setup required: None.

### Test Function 3: test_multiplication
- Function name and signature: `test_multiplication()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: To ensure that the multiplication function works correctly.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two integers, both positive and negative.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The function should return the product of the two input integers.
- Any mocking or setup required: None.

### Test Function 4: test_division
- Function name and signature: `test_division()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: To ensure that the division function works correctly.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two integers, both positive and negative.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The function should return the quotient of the two input integers.
- Any mocking or setup required: None.

### Test Function 5: test_division_by_zero
- Function name and signature: `test_division_by_zero()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: To ensure that the division function handles division by zero correctly.
- Input parameters and test data used: A positive integer and zero.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The function should raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.
- Any mocking or setup required: None.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is designed to cover a broad range of scenarios. The tests are designed to cover both happy path and edge cases. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of the common functions in the common module. The tests are designed to cover both positive and negative integers, as well as division by zero.

## Technical Details
- Required imports and their purposes: `from common import *`
- Test framework being used: PyTest
- Any mock objects and why they're needed: None
- Test data and fixtures used: None

## Running and Debugging
To run the tests, use the following command: `pytest -v`

Prerequisites: Ensure that pytest is installed in your environment.

How to debug failures: Use the `pytest-trace` plugin to trace the execution of the tests.

Common issues and solutions: None

## Code Structure Analysis
The code structure is straightforward and follows the standard Python testing pattern. The tests are organized into separate functions, each with a specific purpose and validation. The test data is used to provide the input for the tests. The test framework is PyTest, which is a mature and flexible testing tool.
