CRITICAL: Analyze the actual test code and provide specific, detailed explanations based on what the code actually does.

Test Code:
```javascript
    it('should allow new ARIA 1.3 attributes', async () => {
      // Test aria-braillelabel
      await mountComponent({'aria-braillelabel': 'Braille label text'});
      
      // Test aria-brailleroledescription
      await mountComponent({'aria-brailleroledescription': 'Navigation menu'});
      
      // Test aria-colindextext
      await mountComponent({'aria-colindextext': 'Column A'});
      
      // Test aria-rowindextext
      await mountComponent({'aria-rowindextext': 'Row 1'});
      
      // Test multiple ARIA 1.3 attributes together
      await mountComponent({
        'aria-braillelabel': 'Braille text',
        'aria-colindextext': 'First column',
        'aria-rowindextext': 'First row',
