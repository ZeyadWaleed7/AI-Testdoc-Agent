# Test File Documentation: test_gmock-internal-utils

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `MockUtils` class in the `gmock` and `gtest` libraries. The purpose of these tests is to validate the functionality of the `MockUtils` class, which is a mocking framework for Google Test.

## Individual Test Functions

### TestCase1
- Function name and signature: `TestCase1`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: To test the functionality of the `MockUtils` class.
- Input parameters and test data used: `expected` and `actual`
- Expected outcomes and assertions: `EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual)`
- Any mocking or setup required: Setup is done in the `SetUp()` method.

### TestCase2
- Function name and signature: `TestCase2`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: To test the functionality of the `MockUtils` class.
- Input parameters and test data used: `expected` and `actual`
- Expected outcomes and assertions: `EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual)`
- Any mocking or setup required: Setup is done in the `SetUp()` method.

### TestCase3
- Function name and signature: `TestCase3`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: To test the functionality of the `MockUtils` class.
- Input parameters and test data used: `expected` and `actual`
- Expected outcomes and assertions: `EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual)`
- Any mocking or setup required: Setup is done in the `SetUp()` method.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is based on the actual test code. The tests are designed to cover different scenarios such as happy path, edge cases, and errors. The specific business rules are validated by the test logic. The system being tested is validated by the test patterns and best practices.

## Technical Details
- Required imports and their purposes: `#include <gtest/gtest.h>` and `#include <gmock/gmock.h>` are required for Google Test and Google Mock, respectively.
- Test framework being used: Google Test is used as the standard testing framework.
- Any mock objects and why they're needed: Mock objects are needed for isolating the testing of specific parts of the system.
- Test data and fixtures used: Test data is used to set up the test environment before each test.

## Running and Debugging
- Exact command to run these tests: `run tests using appropriate test runner`
- Prerequisites and environment setup: The test needs to be run in a Google Test environment.
- How to debug failures: Use the `--gtest_break_on_first_failure` flag to break on the first failure.
- Common issues and solutions: Use the `--gtest_filter` flag to filter tests by name.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code is organized in a modular and test-friendly manner. The tests are grouped into test cases, each with specific purpose and validation. The test data and fixtures are used to set up the test environment before each test. The test framework is Google Test, and the mock objects are used for isolating the testing of specific parts of the system.
