## Test File Documentation: test_FileSchema

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `FileSchema` class. It covers a variety of scenarios, including happy path, edge cases, error conditions, and error handling. The main purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `FileSchema` class is able to handle various file formats and conversions.

## Individual Test Functions

### `testNormalCases()`
- Function name and signature: `testNormalCases()`
- Purpose: Validate the `FileSchema` class with normal cases.
- Input parameters: None
- Expected outcomes: The `FileSchema` class should be able to handle normal cases.
- Assertions: The `FileSchema` class should return valid results for normal cases.
- Mocking or setup required: None

### `testEdgeCases()`
- Function name and signature: `testEdgeCases()`
- Purpose: Validate the `FileSchema` class with edge cases.
- Input parameters: None
- Expected outcomes: The `FileSchema` class should be able to handle edge cases.
- Assertions: The `FileSchema` class should return valid results for edge cases.
- Mocking or setup required: None

### `testErrorConditions()`
- Function name and signature: `testErrorConditions()`
- Purpose: Validate the `FileSchema` class with error conditions.
- Input parameters: None
- Expected outcomes: The `FileSchema` class should be able to handle error conditions.
- Assertions: The `FileSchema` class should return valid results for error conditions.
- Mocking or setup required: None

### `testErrorHandling()`
- Function name and signature: `testErrorHandling()`
- Purpose: Validate the `FileSchema` class with error handling.
- Input parameters: None
- Expected outcomes: The `FileSchema` class should be able to handle error handling.
- Assertions: The `FileSchema` class should return valid results for error handling.
- Mocking or setup required: None

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is based on the actual test code. The test file is designed to cover a wide range of scenarios, including happy path, edge cases, error conditions, and error handling. The main purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `FileSchema` class is able to handle various file formats and conversions.

The test coverage is as follows:
- Happy path: All normal cases are covered.
- Edge cases: All edge cases are covered.
- Error conditions: All error conditions are covered.
- Error handling: All error handling scenarios are covered.

The specific business rules are validated by the tests. The system being tested is the `FileSchema` class.

The test patterns and best practices followed are:
- The tests are grouped by functionality.
- The tests are independent and can be run in any order.
- The tests are isolated from each other.
- The tests are fast and deterministic.

## Running and Debugging
- Command to run these tests: `mvn test`
- Prerequisites: Maven, Java 8 or later
- Debugging: Use the test debugging tools provided by your IDE or test runner.
- Common issues and solutions: Use logging to track the test progress and identify any issues.

## Code Structure Analysis
- The code is organized into a test class `FileSchemaTest`.
- Naming conventions: The names of the functions and variables are descriptive and follow Java naming conventions.
- Test patterns: The tests are grouped into individual test functions.
- Best practices: The tests are isolated from each other and are fast and deterministic.
