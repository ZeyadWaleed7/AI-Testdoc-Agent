## Running and Debugging
To run the tests, execute the following command: `mvn test`

Prerequisites:
- Maven
- DuckDB installed and running
- Junit 5

Debugging:
- Use the test name or the test class to debug failures.

Common issues and solutions:
- Use logging to track the flow of the application.
- Use assertions to validate the expected outcomes.
- Use mocking to isolate the test from external dependencies.
