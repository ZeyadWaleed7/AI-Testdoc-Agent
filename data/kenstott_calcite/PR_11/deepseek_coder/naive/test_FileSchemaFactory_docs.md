## Test File Documentation: test_FileSchemaFactory

## Overview
The test file `test_FileSchemaFactory.md` is designed to test the functionality of the `FileSchemaFactory` class in the `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.duckdb` package. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `FileSchemaFactory` class is functioning correctly in a variety of scenarios, including happy path, edge cases, and error conditions.

## Individual Test Functions

### testNormalCase
- Function name and signature: `testNormalCase()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: This test function is designed to test the normal operation of the `FileSchemaFactory` class. It validates that the `FileSchemaFactory` can create a `Schema` object from a DuckDB database.
- Input parameters and test data used: A DuckDB database and a test table.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `FileSchemaFactory` should be able to create a `Schema` object from the DuckDB database.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testEdgeCase
- Function name and signature: `testEdgeCase()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: This test function is designed to test the edge cases of the `FileSchemaFactory` class. It validates that the `FileSchemaFactory` can handle edge cases such as null or empty inputs.
- Input parameters and test data used: A DuckDB database and an empty or null test table.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `FileSchemaFactory` should be able to handle edge cases such as null or empty inputs.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testErrorCondition
- Function name and signature: `testErrorCondition()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: This test function is designed to test the error conditions of the `FileSchemaFactory` class. It validates that the `FileSchemaFactory` can handle error conditions such as database connection failures or table not found errors.
- Input parameters and test data used: A DuckDB database and a non-existent test table.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `FileSchemaFactory` should be able to handle error conditions such as database connection failures or table not found errors.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.
