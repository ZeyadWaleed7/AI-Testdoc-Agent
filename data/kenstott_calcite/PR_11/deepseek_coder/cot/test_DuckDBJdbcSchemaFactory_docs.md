## Test File Documentation: test_DuckDBJdbcSchemaFactory

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the DuckDBJdbcSchemaFactory class. The class is responsible for creating and managing JDBC schemas using DuckDB. The main purpose of these tests is to ensure that the class correctly handles different scenarios, including happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions.

## Individual Test Functions

### testNormalCases
- Function name and signature: `createSchema(String url, String username, String password)`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function is designed to test the normal operation of the class. It creates a schema using a valid URL, username, and password.
- Input parameters and test data used: A valid URL, a non-empty username, and a non-empty password.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The schema should be created successfully.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testEdgeCases
- Function name and signature: `createSchema(String url, String username, String password)`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function is designed to test the edge cases of the class. It tests the class with null inputs, empty usernames, and empty passwords.
- Input parameters and test data used: Null inputs, empty usernames, and empty passwords.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The class should throw IllegalArgumentException for null inputs, empty usernames, and empty passwords.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testErrorConditions
- Function name and signature: `createSchema(String url, String username, String password)`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function is designed to test the error conditions of the class. It tests the class with invalid schema URLs.
- Input parameters and test data used: An invalid schema URL.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The class should not create a schema with the invalid URL.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testDependencies
- Function name and signature: `createSchema(String url, String username, String password)`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function is designed to test the dependencies of the class. It tests the class with the class loader.
- Input parameters and test data used: No input parameters.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The class should return the class loader of the class.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testDataAndFixtures
- Function name and signature: `createSchema(String url, String username, String password)`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function is designed to test the test data and fixtures of the class. It tests the class with test data.
- Input parameters and test data used: A valid URL, a non-empty username, and a non-empty password.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The schema should be created successfully.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy is to cover all happy path scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions. The coverage will be as follows:
- Happy path scenarios: All test cases in the testNormalCases function will pass.
- Edge cases: All test cases in the testEdgeCases function will pass.
- Error conditions: All test cases in the testErrorConditions function will pass.
- Business rules: The class will correctly handle null inputs, empty usernames, and empty passwords.
- System tested: The class will be tested with DuckDB and JDBC.

## Running and Debugging
To run these tests, use the following command: `mvn test`

## Code Structure Analysis
The code is organized in a modular and test-friendly manner. The test file is divided into several test functions, each with specific purposes and validations. The test functions are named according to their purpose and the functionality they validate. The test data and fixtures are not used in this test file.
