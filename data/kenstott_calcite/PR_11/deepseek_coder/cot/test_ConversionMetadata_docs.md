## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `ConversionMetadata` class. It covers two main scenarios:

1. A successful read of metadata from a JSON file.
2. A failure in reading metadata from a JSON file.

The main purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `ConversionMetadata` class is able to correctly read and handle metadata from a JSON file. The tests also validate the `ConversionMetadata` class's behavior in the event of a failure during metadata reading.

## Individual Test Functions

### testReadMetadata_Success
- Function name: `testReadMetadata_Success`
- Purpose: Validate that the `ConversionMetadata` class can successfully read metadata from a JSON file.
- Input parameters: `metadataFile` (the JSON file to read metadata from), `mockMapper` (the mock ObjectMapper instance)
- Expected outcomes: The `ConversionMetadata` instance should be successfully created and populated with the data from the JSON file.
- Assertions: The `ConversionMetadata` instance should not be null.
- Mocking or setup required: `when(mockMapper.readValue(metadataFile, ConversionMetadata.class)).thenReturn(new ConversionMetadata());`

### testReadMetadata_Failure
- Function name: `testReadMetadata_Failure`
- Purpose: Validate that the `ConversionMetadata` class can handle failures during metadata reading.
- Input parameters: `metadataFile` (the JSON file to read metadata from), `mockMapper` (the mock ObjectMapper instance)
- Expected outcomes: The `ConversionMetadata` instance should throw a `RuntimeException`.
- Assertions: The `ConversionMetadata` instance should throw a `RuntimeException`.
- Mocking or setup required: `when(mockMapper.readValue(metadataFile, ConversionMetadata.class)).thenThrow(new RuntimeException());`

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy is to cover both happy path and edge case scenarios. The happy path scenario is the successful read of metadata from a JSON file, while the edge case scenario is the failure in reading metadata from a JSON file.

The test coverage is to ensure that the `ConversionMetadata` class's behavior is correctly validated. The system being tested is the `ConversionMetadata` class, and the features being validated are the ability to read metadata from a JSON file.

The test patterns are to ensure that the tests are independent and can be run in any order. The test data and fixtures used are the JSON file to read metadata from and the expected outcome of the read operation.

## Running and Debugging
- Command to run tests: `mvn test`
- Prerequisites: `mvn clean install`
- Debugging: Use the `mvn test` command followed by `mvn test -Dtest=ConversionMetadataTest#testReadMetadata_Failure` to debug the failure test.
- Common issues and solutions: Ensure that the JSON file exists and is correctly formatted. Also, ensure that the JSON file is in the correct location for the test to find it.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code is organized into two test functions: `testReadMetadata_Success` and `testReadMetadata_Failure`. Each function follows the same structure: setup, function, assertions, and mocking or setup. The setup involves creating a mock `ObjectMapper` instance and setting up the function to read metadata from a JSON file. The function is the actual test, which validates the behavior of the `ConversionMetadata` class. The assertions are checking that the function returns a non-null value. The mocking or setup is setting up the function to return a mock `ConversionMetadata` instance when the function reads the JSON file, and to throw a `RuntimeException` when the function fails to read the JSON file.
