# Test File Documentation: test_FileSchemaFactory

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `FileSchemaFactory` class in the `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.duckdb` package. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `FileSchemaFactory` class is able to create schemas for different types of files, with different parameters. The tests cover normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions.

## Individual Test Functions

### testCreateSchema_normalCase
- Function name and signature: `createSchema(String filePath, String schemaName)`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test validates the `createSchema` method by creating a schema with a specified file path and schema name.
- Input parameters: `filePath` (a non-empty string), `schemaName` (a non-empty string)
- Expected outcomes: A `Schema` object is returned.
- Assertions: The returned schema should have a non-empty name.
- Mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testCreateSchema_edgeCase
- Function name and signature: `createSchema(String filePath, String schemaName)`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test validates the `createSchema` method by creating a schema with an empty file path and a null schema name.
- Input parameters: `filePath` (an empty string), `schemaName` (null)
- Expected outcomes: An `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- Assertions: The exception should be an `IllegalArgumentException`.
- Mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testCreateSchema_errorCondition
- Function name and signature: `createSchema(String filePath, String schemaName)`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test validates the `createSchema` method by creating a schema with a null file path and a non-empty schema name.
- Input parameters: `filePath` (null), `schemaName` (a non-empty string)
- Expected outcomes: An `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.
- Assertions: The exception should be an `IllegalArgumentException`.
- Mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy is to cover all possible scenarios:
- Happy path: Normal cases where the file path and schema name are valid.
- Edge cases: Edge cases where the file path is empty, schema name is null, and the file path is null.
- Error conditions: Error conditions where the file path is null and schema name is not.

The coverage is based on the actual test code:
- Normal cases: All normal cases are covered.
- Edge cases: The edge cases are covered.
- Error conditions: The error conditions are covered.

The system being tested is the `FileSchemaFactory` class, which is responsible for creating schemas for different types of files.

## Technical Details
- Required imports: `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.duckdb.DuckDBJdbcSchemaFactory`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.execution.ExecutionEngineConfig`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.execution.duckdb.DuckDBConfig`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.metadata.InformationSchema`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.metadata.PostgresMetadataSchema`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.jdbc.JdbcSchema`, `org.apache.calcite.model.ModelHandler`, `org.apache.calcite.schema.Schema`, `org.apache.calcite.schema.SchemaFactory`, `org.apache.calcite.schema.SchemaPlus`
- Test framework: `junit`
- Mock objects: No mock objects are needed for this test.
- Test data: No test data is used.

## Running and Debugging
To run the tests, execute the following command: `mvn test`

Prerequisites: Ensure that Maven is installed and the project is set up correctly.

To debug failures, use the `-Dtest=` flag followed by the test class name in the command line. For example, `mvn test -Dtest=FileSchemaFactoryTest`

Common issues and solutions:
- Ensure that the file path and schema name are valid.
- Ensure that the file path is not empty.
- Ensure that the schema name is not null.
- Ensure that the file path is not null.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code is organized in a modular and test-friendly manner. The `FileSchemaFactory` class is divided into several methods, each responsible for a specific task. The test methods are grouped into separate test classes, each with specific tests to validate different aspects of the `FileSchemaFactory` class.
