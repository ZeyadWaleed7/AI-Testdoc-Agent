# Test File Documentation: test_FileSchema

## Overview
The test file `FileSchemaTest` is designed to test the `FileSchema` class in the `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file` package. The purpose of these tests is to validate the functionality of the `FileSchema` class, which is responsible for handling file schema conversions.

## Individual Test Functions

### testNormalCases
- Function name and signature: `testNormalCases()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test case is designed to validate the `FileSchema` class's functionality when given a valid file path.
- Input parameters and test data used: A valid file path.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `FileSchema` class should be able to successfully convert the file schema based on the file type.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test case.

### testEdgeCases
- Function name and signature: `testEdgeCases()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test case is designed to validate the `FileSchema` class's behavior when given edge cases such as null, empty, and non-existent file paths.
- Input parameters and test data used: Edge cases such as null, empty, and non-existent file paths.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `FileSchema` class should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when given an invalid file path.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test case.

### testErrorConditions
- Function name and signature: `testErrorConditions()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test case is designed to validate the `FileSchema` class's behavior when given error conditions such as non-string file paths, non-accessible file paths, etc.
- Input parameters and test data used: Error conditions such as non-string file paths, non-accessible file paths, etc.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `FileSchema` class should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when given an invalid file path.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test case.
