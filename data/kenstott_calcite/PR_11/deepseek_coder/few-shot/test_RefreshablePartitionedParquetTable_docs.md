# Test File Documentation: test_RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class. The class is responsible for managing and refreshing partitioned Parquet tables. The tests cover a variety of scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions.

## Individual Test Functions

### testBasicOperations
- Function name and signature: `testBasicOperations()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the basic operations of the `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class. It tests the addition of two numbers, and handles edge cases and zero values.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two integers, one positive and one negative.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The function should return the sum of the two input numbers, and if the input numbers are zero, the result should be zero.
- Mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### More test functions can be added for error conditions and edge cases as needed.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is based on the actual test code. The test file is designed to cover a wide range of scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of the `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class.

### Scenarios Covered
- Normal cases: Tests the addition of two numbers, and handles edge cases and zero values.
- Edge cases: Tests the addition of two numbers that are too large or too small to fit in a standard data type.
- Error conditions: Tests the handling of invalid input, such as null or negative values.

### Business Rules Validated
- The `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class is responsible for managing and refreshing partitioned Parquet tables.
- The tests validate the functionality of the class by testing the addition of two numbers, and handling edge cases and zero values.

### System Under Test
- The `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class is tested to ensure it correctly handles and refreshes partitioned Parquet tables.
- The tests are designed to cover a wide range of scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions.
