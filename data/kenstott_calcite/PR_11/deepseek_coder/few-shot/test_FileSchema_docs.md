## Test File Documentation: test_FileSchema

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the Calculator class in the CalculatorTest class. The purpose of these tests is to validate the functionality of the add method in the Calculator class. The tests cover different scenarios such as happy path, edge cases, and errors.

## Individual Test Functions

### testBasicAddition
- Function name and signature: `testBasicAddition()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test validates the basic addition functionality of the add method in the Calculator class. It checks if the add method correctly adds two numbers.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two integers (2 and 3 in this case)
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The method should return the sum of the two numbers.
- Any mocking or setup required: None

### testEdgeCases
- Function name and signature: `testEdgeCases()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test validates the edge cases functionality of the add method in the Calculator class. It checks if the add method correctly handles edge cases such as negative numbers and zero.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two integers (1000000 and 2000000 in this case)
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The method should return the sum of the two numbers correctly.
- Any mocking or setup required: None

### testZeroHandling
- Function name and signature: `testZeroHandling()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test validates the zero handling functionality of the add method in the Calculator class. It checks if the add method correctly handles zero as input.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two integers (5 and 0 in this case)
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The method should return the sum of the two numbers correctly.
- Any mocking or setup required: None

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is based on the actual test code. The test code covers different scenarios such as happy path, edge cases, and errors. The test coverage includes:
- Happy path: The add method correctly adds two numbers.
- Edge cases: The add method correctly handles edge cases such as negative numbers and zero.
- Errors: The add method should not break when given invalid input.

The test strategy is based on the requirements of the add method in the Calculator class. The purpose of these tests is to validate the functionality of the add method in the Calculator class.

## Running and Debugging
- Command to run these tests: `mvn test`
- Prerequisites and environment setup: Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed and the project is set up correctly.
- How to debug failures: Use the test logs or the test report to identify the cause of the failure.
- Common issues and solutions: Use the test logs or the test report to identify common issues and their solutions.

## Code Structure Analysis
- How the tests are organized: The tests are organized in a test class named CalculatorTest. Each test function is a separate test case.
- Naming conventions used: The names of the test functions follow the naming convention of `testFunctionName()`.
- Test patterns and best practices followed: The test patterns and best practices follow the JUnit naming conventions.
