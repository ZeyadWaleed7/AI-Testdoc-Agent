# Test File Documentation: test_FileSchemaFactory

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `Calculator` class in the `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.duckdb.DuckDBJdbcSchemaFactory` package. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `Calculator` class is functioning correctly under various scenarios, including edge cases and zero handling.

## Individual Test Functions

### testBasicAddition
- Function name and signature: `testBasicAddition()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the basic addition functionality of the `Calculator` class. It checks if the `add()` method of the `Calculator` class correctly adds two numbers.
- Input parameters and test data used: `2` and `3`
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `assertEquals()` method is used to assert that the result of the addition operation is as expected.
- Mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testEdgeCases
- Function name and signature: `testEdgeCases()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the edge cases handling of the `Calculator` class. It checks if the `add()` method of the `Calculator` class correctly handles edge cases such as negative numbers and large numbers.
- Input parameters and test data used: `-1000000` and `2000000`
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `assertEquals()` method is used to assert that the result of the addition operation is as expected.
- Mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testZeroHandling
- Function name and signature: `testZeroHandling()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the zero handling functionality of the `Calculator` class. It checks if the `add()` method of the `Calculator` class correctly handles zero inputs.
- Input parameters and test data used: `0` and `5`
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `assertEquals()` method is used to assert that the result of the addition operation is as expected.
- Mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is based on the actual test code. The test file is designed to cover the following scenarios:
- Happy path: Tests the `add()` method of the `Calculator` class with valid inputs.
- Edge cases: Tests the `add()` method of the `Calculator` class with edge cases such as negative numbers and large numbers.
- Errors: No specific error handling is tested in this test file.

The test coverage is based on the functionality of the `Calculator` class. The `add()` method is the only method that is tested in this test file. The other methods in the `Calculator` class are not tested because they are not the primary functionality of the class.

The test file is designed to validate the `Calculator` class's functionality. It validates the `add()` method by adding two numbers and checking if the result is as expected.

- Required imports and their purposes: `import org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.duckdb.DuckDBJdbcSchemaFactory;`, `import org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.execution.ExecutionEngineConfig;`, `import org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.execution.duckdb.DuckDBConfig;`, `import org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.metadata.InformationSchema;`, `import org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.metadata.PostgresMetadataSchema;`, `import org.apache.calcite.adapter.jdbc.JdbcSchema;`, `import org.apache.calcite.model.ModelHandler;`, `import org.apache.calcite.schema.Schema;`, `import org.apache.calcite.schema.SchemaFactory;`, `import org.apache.calcite.schema.SchemaPlus;`
- Test framework being used: `junit`
- Mock objects and why they're needed: No mock objects are needed for this test file.
- Test data and fixtures used: No specific test data or fixtures are used in this test file.

## Running and Debugging
To run the tests, the command is `mvn test`. Prerequisites and environment setup are not specified in this test file. Debugging failures is not required for this test file. Common issues and solutions are not provided in this test file.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code structure of this test file is straightforward. The test functions are grouped together in the `CalculatorTest` class. The test functions are annotated with `@Test`, which is a JUnit annotation. The test functions are ordered by their specific purpose and validation. The test file is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand the purpose and functionality of each test function.
