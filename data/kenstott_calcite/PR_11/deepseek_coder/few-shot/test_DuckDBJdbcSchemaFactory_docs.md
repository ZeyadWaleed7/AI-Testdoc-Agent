# Test File Documentation: test_DuckDBJdbcSchemaFactory

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `Calculator` class in the `org.apache.calcite.adapter.jdbc` package. The purpose of these tests is to validate the `add` method in the `Calculator` class, which is a simple arithmetic operation.

## Individual Test Functions

### testBasicAddition
- Function name and signature: `testBasicAddition()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `add` method in the `Calculator` class. It tests the addition of two numbers, both positive and negative, and zero.
- Input parameters and test data used: `2`, `3`, `0`, `-1`, `-2`
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `assertEquals` method is used to assert that the result of the `add` method is equal to the expected result.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testEdgeCases
- Function name and signature: `testEdgeCases()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `add` method in the `Calculator` class. It tests the addition of two numbers that are very large or very small.
- Input parameters and test data used: `1000000`, `2000000`, `-100`, `-200`
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `assertEquals` method is used to assert that the result of the `add` method is equal to the expected result.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testZeroHandling
- Function name and signature: `testZeroHandling()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `add` method in the `Calculator` class. It tests the addition of two numbers that are both zero.
- Input parameters and test data used: `0`, `0`
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `assertEquals` method is used to assert that the result of the `add` method is equal to the expected result.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

## Explanation
The test file is designed to test the `add` method in the `Calculator` class in the `org.apache.calcite.adapter.jdbc` package. The `add` method is a simple arithmetic operation that is tested in the following ways:
- Happy path: The `add` method is tested with positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero.
- Edge cases: The `add` method is tested with very large numbers and very small numbers.
- Errors: No errors are found in this test file.
