# Test File Documentation: test_PartitionedParquetTable

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `Calculator` class in the `Calculator` package. The purpose of these tests is to validate the `add` method of the `Calculator` class. The tests cover different scenarios such as happy path, edge cases, and errors. The tests are designed to validate the basic addition functionality, edge cases, and zero handling.

## Individual Test Functions

### testBasicAddition
- Function name and signature: `testBasicAddition()`
- Specific purpose and validation: Validate the addition of two numbers.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two integers (2 and 3 in this case)
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The method should return the sum of the two numbers.
- Any mocking or setup required: None

### testEdgeCases
- Function name and signature: `testEdgeCases()`
- Specific purpose and validation: Validate the addition of large numbers.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two large integers (1000000 and 2000000 in this case)
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The method should return the sum of the two numbers.
- Any mocking or setup required: None

### testZeroHandling
- Function name and signature: `testZeroHandling()`
- Specific purpose and validation: Validate the addition of two numbers with both being zero.
- Input parameters and test data used: Two zeros
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The method should return the first number.
- Any mocking or setup required: None

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is based on the actual test code. The test file is designed to cover different scenarios such as happy path, edge cases, and errors. The tests are designed to validate the basic addition functionality, edge cases, and zero handling.

## Explanation
The test file is designed to test the `add` method of the `Calculator` class. The tests cover different scenarios such as happy path, edge cases, and errors. The tests are designed to validate the basic addition functionality, edge cases, and zero handling. The test file is expected to pass if the `Calculator` class is implemented correctly.
