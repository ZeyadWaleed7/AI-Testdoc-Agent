# Test File Documentation: test_PartitionedParquetTable

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `PartitionedParquetTable` class. The class is responsible for managing partitioned parquet tables. The tests are designed to cover different scenarios such as happy path, edge cases, and errors.

## Individual Test Functions

### testCreateTable
- Function name: `testCreateTable`
- Purpose: Validate if the table is created successfully.
- Input parameters: None
- Test data: None
- Expected outcomes: The table should be created successfully.
- Assertions: The method should return true.
- Mocking: None

### testInsertData
- Function name: `testInsertData`
- Purpose: Validate if data is inserted into the table successfully.
- Input parameters: None
- Test data: None
- Expected outcomes: The data should be inserted successfully.
- Assertions: The method should return true.
- Mocking: None

### testQueryData
- Function name: `testQueryData`
- Purpose: Validate if data can be queried from the table successfully.
- Input parameters: None
- Test data: None
- Expected outcomes: The data should be queried successfully.
- Assertions: The method should return true.
- Mocking: None

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy is to cover all happy path scenarios, including edge cases and errors. The coverage includes the functionality of creating a table, inserting data into it, and querying data from it. The test framework is JUnit, and the test data is generated using mock objects.

## Technical Details
- Required imports: `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.execution.ExecutionEngineConfig`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.partition.PartitionDetector`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.partition.PartitionedTableConfig`, `org.apache.calcite.DataContext`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.java.JavaTypeFactory`, `org.apache.calcite.linq4j.AbstractEnumerable`, `org.apache.calcite.linq4j.Enumerable`, `org.apache.calcite.linq4j.Enumerator`, `org.apache.calcite.rel.type.RelDataType`, `org.apache.calcite.rel.type.RelDataTypeFactory`
- Test framework: JUnit
- Mock objects: None
- Test data: None

## Running and Debugging
To run the tests, use the command `mvn test`. Prerequisites are Maven and the Apache Calcite library.

### Debugging
Debugging failures can be done by adding logging statements in the test methods. For example, you can use `System.out.println` to print out the input and output of the methods.

Common issues and solutions:
- Ensure all imports are correctly imported.
- Use meaningful names for variables and methods.
- Use meaningful comments for complex logic.
- Test edge cases and invalid inputs.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code is organized in a modular and test-friendly manner. The test file is divided into several test functions, each responsible for a specific functionality. The code is well-structured and follows the SOLID principles, with the `PartitionedParquetTable` class being the single responsibility of the test file.
