# Test File Documentation: test_FileSchemaFactory

## Overview
The test file `test_FileSchemaFactory.md` is designed to test the `FileSchemaFactory` class in the `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.duckdb` package. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `FileSchemaFactory` class is functioning correctly and producing the expected results.

## Individual Test Functions

### `testCreateFileSchema()`
- Function name and signature: `testCreateFileSchema()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: This function tests the `createFileSchema()` method of the `FileSchemaFactory` class. It creates a `FileSchema` object with a given file name and content, and asserts that the file name and content are correctly set.
- Input parameters and test data used: A file name (`fileName`) and content (`content`)
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `createFileSchema()` method should return a `FileSchema` object with the correct file name and content.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking or setup is required for this test.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage for this test file is as follows:
- The `testCreateFileSchema()` function is the only test in this file. Therefore, it covers the entire functionality of the `FileSchemaFactory` class.
- The `createFileSchema()` method is validating the functionality of the `FileSchemaFactory` class.
- The `FileSchemaFactory` class is being tested to ensure that it can create a `FileSchema` object with a given file name and content.

## Technical Details
- Required imports and their purposes: `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.duckdb.FileSchemaFactory`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.execution.ExecutionEngineConfig`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.execution.duckdb.DuckDBConfig`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.metadata.InformationSchema`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.metadata.PostgresMetadataSchema`, `org.apache.calcite.adapter.jdbc.JdbcSchema`, `org.apache.calcite.model.ModelHandler`, `org.apache.calcite.schema.Schema`, `org.apache.calcite.schema.SchemaFactory`, `org.apache.calcite.schema.SchemaPlus`
- Test framework being used: JUnit 5
- Any mock objects and why they're needed: No mock objects are needed for this test.
- Test data and fixtures used: No test data or fixtures are used in this test.

## Running and Debugging
To run these tests, execute the following command: `mvn test`

Prerequisites and environment setup: Ensure that Maven is installed and the project is set up correctly.

How to debug failures: Use the `-D` flag followed by the test class and method name to debug the test. For example, `mvn test -Dtest=FileSchemaFactoryTest#testCreateFileSchema`

Common issues and solutions: No common issues or solutions are identified in this test file.
