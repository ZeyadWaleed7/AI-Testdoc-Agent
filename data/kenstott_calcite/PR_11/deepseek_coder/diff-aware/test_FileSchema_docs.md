## Overview
The test file `FileSchemaTest` is designed to test the functionality of the `FileSchema` class. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `FileSchema` class is functioning correctly and that it correctly handles all possible scenarios. The tests are designed to cover happy path scenarios, edge cases, and errors.

## Individual Test Functions

### testSetAndGetName
- Function name: `testSetAndGetName`
- Purpose: To test the functionality of setting and getting the name of the file schema.
- Input parameters: None
- Test data: A string value
- Expected outcomes: The name should be set and retrieved correctly.
- Assertions: The name should match the test data.
- Mocking or setup required: None

### testSetAndGetPath
- Function name: `testSetAndGetPath`
- Purpose: To test the functionality of setting and getting the path of the file schema.
- Input parameters: None
- Test data: A string value
- Expected outcomes: The path should be set and retrieved correctly.
- Assertions: The path should match the test data.
- Mocking or setup required: None

### testSetAndGetSize
- Function name: `testSetAndGetSize`
- Purpose: To test the functionality of setting and getting the size of the file schema.
- Input parameters: None
- Test data: A long value
- Expected outcomes: The size should be set and retrieved correctly.
- Assertions: The size should match the test data.
- Mocking or setup required: None

### testSetAndGetCreationTime
- Function name: `testSetAndGetCreationTime`
- Purpose: To test the functionality of setting and getting the creation time of the file schema.
- Input parameters: None
- Test data: A long value
- Expected outcomes: The creation time should be set and retrieved correctly.
- Assertions: The creation time should match the test data.
- Mocking or setup required: None

### testSetAndGetModificationTime
- Function name: `testSetAndGetModificationTime`
- Purpose: To test the functionality of setting and getting the modification time of the file schema.
- Input parameters: None
- Test data: A long value
- Expected outcomes: The modification time should be set and retrieved correctly.
- Assertions: The modification time should match the test data.
- Mocking or setup required: None

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is based on the actual test code. The tests are designed to cover all possible scenarios:
- Happy path: All the methods are called with valid input, and the output is as expected.
- Edge cases: The methods are called with invalid input (e.g., null, negative values), and the output is still as expected.
- Errors: The methods are called with invalid input (e.g., negative values), and the output is an error.

The tests are designed to validate the following business rules:
- The `FileSchema` class is designed to handle file schema information.
- The `setName`, `setPath`, `setSize`, `setCreationTime`, and `setModificationTime` methods are used to set and get the file schema information.

The system being tested is:
- `FileSchema`: A class that handles file schema information.

- Test framework: `junit`
- Mock objects: None
- Test data: None

## Running and Debugging
- Command to run these tests: `mvn test`
- Prerequisites: The necessary dependencies and tools are installed.
- Debugging: Use the test debugging tools provided by the test framework.
- Common issues and solutions: Use the test logs and error messages to identify and fix common issues.

## Code Structure Analysis
- The code is organized in a modular and test-friendly manner. The `FileSchemaTest` class is the main test class, and the individual test methods are in the `FileSchema` class.
- Naming conventions: The names of the methods and variables are descriptive and follow the Java naming conventions.
- Test patterns: The tests are designed to cover all possible scenarios.

## Explanation
The `FileSchemaTest` class is designed to test the `FileSchema` class. The `FileSchema` class is a data class that handles file schema information. The tests are designed to cover all possible scenarios:
- Happy path: The `FileSchema` class is called with valid input, and the output is as expected.
- Edge cases: The `FileSchema` class is called with invalid input (e.g., null, negative values), and the output is still as expected.
- Errors: The `FileSchema` class is called with invalid input (e.g., negative values), and the output is an error.
