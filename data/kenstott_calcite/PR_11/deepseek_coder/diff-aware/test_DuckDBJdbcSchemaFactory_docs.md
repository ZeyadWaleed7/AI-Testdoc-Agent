# Test File Documentation: test_DuckDBJdbcSchemaFactory

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the DuckDBJdbcSchemaFactory class. The class is responsible for creating and manipulating schemas in DuckDB, a database engine that supports SQL. The tests are designed to cover the following functionality:

- Creating a schema
- Creating a table in a schema
- Inserting data into a table
- Selecting data from a table

## Individual Test Functions

### testCreateSchema
- Function name: `testCreateSchema`
- Purpose: To test the creation of a schema.
- Input parameters: A string representing the name of the schema.
- Test data: A valid schema name.
- Expected outcomes: A SchemaPlus object that represents the created schema.
- Assertions: The test asserts that the creation of the schema is successful.
- Mocking: No mocking is required for this test.

### testCreateTable
- Function name: `testCreateTable`
- Purpose: To test the creation of a table in a schema.
- Input parameters: A string representing the name of the schema, a string representing the name of the table, and a string representing the definition of the table.
- Test data: A valid schema name, table name, and table definition.
- Expected outcomes: A SchemaPlus object that represents the created table.
- Assertions: The test asserts that the creation of the table is successful.
- Mocking: No mocking is required for this test.

### testInsertData
- Function name: `testInsertData`
- Purpose: To test the insertion of data into a table.
- Input parameters: A string representing the name of the schema, a string representing the name of the table, a string representing the column to insert data into, and a value to insert.
- Test data: A valid schema name, table name, column name, and data value.
- Expected outcomes: The data is inserted into the table.
- Assertions: The test asserts that the data is inserted successfully.
- Mocking: No mocking is required for this test.

### testSelectData
- Function name: `testSelectData`
- Purpose: To test the selection of data from a table.
- Input parameters: A string representing the name of the schema, a string representing the name of the table, a string representing the column to select data from, and a value to select.
- Test data: A valid schema name, table name, column name, and data value.
- Expected outcomes: The data is selected from the table.
- Assertions: The test asserts that the data is selected successfully.
- Mocking: No mocking is required for this test.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy is to cover all happy path scenarios, including edge cases and errors. The coverage includes:

- Creating a schema
- Creating a table in a schema
- Inserting data into a table
- Selecting data from a table

The test data is based on the requirements of the functionality being tested. The business logic or features being validated is the ability to create and manipulate schemas in DuckDB, and the ability to insert and select data from tables.

## Technical Details
- Required imports: org.apache.calcite.adapter.jdbc.JdbcSchema, org.apache.calcite.adapter.jdbc.JdbcConvention, org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.format.parquet.ParquetConversionUtil, org.apache.calcite.adapter.file.metadata.ConversionMetadata, org.apache.calcite.avatica.util.Casing, org.apache.calcite.config.Lex, org.apache.calcite.config.NullCollation, org.apache.calcite.linq4j.tree.Expression, org.apache.calcite.schema.Schemas, org.apache.calcite.schema.SchemaPlus
- Test framework: Junit 5
- Mock objects: No mocking is needed for this test.
- Test data: Test data is generated using fixtures provided in the test code.

## Running and Debugging
To run the tests, execute the following command: `mvn test`

Prerequisites: DuckDB must be installed and running.

To debug failures, use the `-Dtest.single` flag followed by the test name. For example, `mvn test -Dtest.single=test_DuckDBJdbcSchemaFactory`

Common issues and solutions:
- Ensure DuckDB is installed and running.
- Check the test data for any invalid data or missing data.
- Use logging to track the flow of the test.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code is organized in a modular and test-friendly manner. The test file is divided into several test functions, each with specific purpose and validation. The test data is generated using fixtures provided in the test code. The test framework is Junit 5, and no mocking is needed for this test.
