# Test File Documentation: test_RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class. The class is responsible for managing and refreshing a partitioned Parquet table.

## Individual Test Functions

### testRefresh
- Function name and signature: `public boolean testRefresh()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: The `refresh()` method of the `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class should return `true` when called.
- Input parameters and test data used: No input parameters are used in this test.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `refresh()` method should return `true`.
- Any mocking or setup required: The `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class should have a `refresh()` method that returns `true`.

### testScan
- Function name and signature: `public List<String> testScan()`
- Specific purpose and what it validates: The `scan()` method of the `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class should return a list of strings when called.
- Input parameters and test data used: No input parameters are used in this test.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `scan()` method should return a list of strings that are equal to the expected result.
- Any mocking or setup required: The `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class should have a `scan()` method that returns a list of strings.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is based on the actual test code. The test file is designed to cover the following scenarios:

- Happy path: The `refresh()` and `scan()` methods of the `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class should return `true`.
- Edge cases: No edge cases are identified in this test file.
- Errors: No errors are identified in this test file.

The test file validates the following business rules:

- The `refresh()` method of the `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class should return `true`.
- The `scan()` method of the `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class should return a list of strings.

The test file is tested for the following parts of the system:

- The `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class.

### Test Framework
The test framework used is JUnit 5. This framework is used for writing repeatable tests and is a good choice for Java.

### Mock Objects
No mock objects are needed in this test file. Mock objects are used for testing the behavior of the code under test.

### Test Data and Fixtures
No test data or fixtures are used in this test file. Test data is used to set up the test environment before each test.

## Running and Debugging
To run these tests, use the following command: `mvn test`

Prerequisites and environment setup:
- Java 11 or later
- Maven
- Test database or a testing database

How to debug failures:
- Use the `-Dtest=` flag followed by the test class name in the command line to run a specific test.
- Use the `-Dfailing-test=` flag followed by the test class name in the command line to run only the failing tests.

Common issues and solutions:
- Use the `-X` flag followed by the test class name in the command line to run the tests in interactive mode.
- Use the `-e` flag followed by the test class name in the command line to run only the failing tests.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code is organized in a modular and test-friendly manner. The `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class is divided into two main parts: `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` and `RefreshableParquetTable`. The `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class is the main class and the `RefreshableParquetTable` class is a helper class.

## Detailed Explanation
The `RefreshablePartitionedParquetTable` class is a helper class for partitioned Parquet tables. It provides methods for refreshing the table and scanning the table. The `refresh()` method refreshes the table and returns `true`. The `scan()` method scans the table and returns a list of strings.
