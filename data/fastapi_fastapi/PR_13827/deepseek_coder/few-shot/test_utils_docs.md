## Overview
The test file is designed to test the `add` function in the `utils.js` file. The function is expected to add two numbers together, handle negative numbers, zero, and large numbers. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `add` function is working correctly and that it handles all edge cases correctly. The tests are also designed to validate the business logic and features that the function is supposed to implement.

## Individual Test Functions

### Test Case 1
- Function Name: `add`
- Signature: `add(a: int, b: int) -> int`
- Purpose: Validate the function by adding two positive integers.
- Input Parameters: `a` and `b`
- Test Data: `2`, `3`
- Expected Outcome: `5`
- Assertions: `expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);`
- Setup: None

### Test Case 2
- Function Name: `add`
- Signature: `add(a: int, b: int) -> int`
- Purpose: Validate the function by adding negative numbers.
- Input Parameters: `a` and `b`
- Test Data: `-1`, `1`
- Expected Outcome: `0`
- Assertions: `expect(add(-1, 1)).toBe(0);`
- Setup: None

### Test Case 3
- Function Name: `add`
- Signature: `add(a: int, b: int) -> int`
- Purpose: Validate the function by adding negative numbers and zero.
- Input Parameters: `a` and `b`
- Test Data: `-100`, `-200`
- Expected Outcome: `-300`
- Assertions: `expect(add(-100, -200)).toBe(-300);`
- Setup: None

### Test Case 4
- Function Name: `add`
- Signature: `add(a: int, b: int) -> int`
- Purpose: Validate the function by adding large numbers.
- Input Parameters: `a` and `b`
- Test Data: `1000000`, `2000000`
- Expected Outcome: `3000000`
- Assertions: `expect(add(1000000, 2000000)).toBe(3000000);`
- Setup: None

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy is to cover all possible scenarios: happy path, edge cases, and errors. The happy path scenarios validate the function by adding two positive integers, negative numbers, zero, and large numbers. The edge cases validate the function by adding negative numbers and zero. The errors validate the function by adding non-numeric inputs. The coverage of the system is to ensure that the `add` function is working correctly and handling all edge cases correctly.

## Technical Details
- Required Imports: `expect`, `test` from '@jest/globals', `add` from '../src/utils.js'
- Test Framework: Jest
- Mocking or Setup Required: None
- Test Data and Fixtures: None

## Running and Debugging
To run the tests, use the command: `npm test`

Prerequisites: Ensure that Jest is installed in your project.

Debugging failures: Use the command: `npm test -- --runInBand`

Common issues and solutions:
- If the tests fail, try running `npm test -- --runInBand` to debug the failures.
- Use `npm test -- --grep <pattern>` to run only the tests that match a given pattern.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code is organized in a modular and clean manner. The `utils.js` file is divided into several modules based on the functionality of the functions. The test file is divided into several test cases based on the functionality of the functions. The test file is designed to be readable and maintainable.

## Explanation
The `add` function in the `utils.js` file is designed to add two numbers together. It handles negative numbers, zero, and large numbers. The test file is designed to validate the `add` function by testing its functionality with different test cases. The test file is designed to cover all possible scenarios: happy path, edge cases, and errors. The test file is designed to be readable and maintainable.
