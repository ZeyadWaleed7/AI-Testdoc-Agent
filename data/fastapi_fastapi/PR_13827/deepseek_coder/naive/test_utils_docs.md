## Test File Documentation: test_utils

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the FastAPI application's functionality. It covers the following specific functionality:

- The FastAPI application's root route "/union_type"
- The FastAPI test client
- The test function `test_read_root`

The main purpose of these tests is to validate the application's functionality and ensure that it behaves as expected under different scenarios. It validates the following business logic or features:

- The FastAPI application's root route
- The FastAPI test client
- The test function `test_read_root`

## Individual Test Functions

### Function: test_read_root

- Function Name: `test_read_root`
- Function Signature: `def test_read_root():`
- Purpose: This function tests the FastAPI application's root route "/union_type". It asserts that the response status code is 200 and the response JSON matches the expected output.
- Input Parameters: None
- Test Data: None
- Expected Outcomes: The response status code should be 200 and the response JSON should match the expected output.
- Setup: None

## Test Strategy and Coverage

The test strategy and coverage is as follows:

- Happy Path: The FastAPI application's root route "/union_type" returns a JSON response with the expected output.
- Edge Cases: None
- Errors: None

The specific business rules being validated are:

- The FastAPI application's root route
- The FastAPI test client
- The test function `test_read_root`

The system being tested is:

- The FastAPI application
- The FastAPI test client
- The test function `test
