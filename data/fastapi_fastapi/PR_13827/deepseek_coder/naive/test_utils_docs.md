You are a technical documentation expert. Create comprehensive documentation for this Py test file.

CRITICAL: Analyze the actual test code and provide specific, detailed explanations based on what the code actually does.

Test Code:
```
import inspect
from contextlib import AsyncExitStack, contextmanager
from copy import copy, deepcopy
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import (
import anyio
from fastapi import params
from fastapi._compat import (
from fastapi.background import BackgroundTasks
from fastapi.concurrency import (

IMPORT REQUIREMENTS:
```

Generate a complete markdown documentation file with the following structure:

# Test File Documentation: test_utils

## Overview
Analyze the test code and explain:
- What specific functionality is being tested
- What the main purpose of these tests is
- What business logic or features are being validated

## Individual Test Functions
For EACH test function in the code, provide:
- Function name and signature
- Specific purpose and what it validates
- Input parameters and test data used
- Expected outcomes and assertions
- Any mocking or setup required

## Test Strategy and Coverage
Based on the actual test code, explain:
- What types of scenarios are covered (happy path, edge cases, errors)
- What specific business rules are being validated
- What parts of the system are being tested

## Technical Details
- Required imports and their purposes
- Test framework being used (standard testing framework)
- Any mock objects and why they're needed
- Test data and fixtures used

## Running and Debugging
- Exact command to run these tests: `run tests using appropriate test runner`
- Prerequisites and environment setup
- How to debug failures
- Common issues and solutions

## Code Structure Analysis
- How the tests are organized
- Naming conventions used
- Test patterns and best practices followed

Generate detailed, specific explanations based on the actual code provided. Avoid generic statements - focus on what this specific test file actually does.
