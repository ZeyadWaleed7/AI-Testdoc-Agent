# Test File Documentation: test_ReverseString

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the `ReverseString` class in the `org.example` package. The purpose of these tests is to validate the functionality of the `reverse` method in the `ReverseString` class. The tests cover different scenarios such as normal cases, edge cases, null handling, and empty string.

## Individual Test Functions

### testNormalCases
- Function name and signature: `testNormalCases()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `reverse` method with normal cases. It checks if the `reverse` method correctly reverses a string.
- Input parameters and test data used: A string `s`.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The method should return the reversed string.
- Any mocking or setup required: None.

### testEdgeCases
- Function name and signature: `testEdgeCases()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `reverse` method with edge cases. It checks if the `reverse` method correctly handles edge cases such as empty strings and strings with only one character.
- Input parameters and test data used: A string `s`.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The method should return the reversed string.
- Any mocking or setup required: None.

### testNullHandling
- Function name and signature: `testNullHandling()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `reverse` method with null handling. It checks if the `reverse` method correctly handles null inputs.
- Input parameters and test data used: A null string.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The method should return null.
- Any mocking or setup required: None.

### testEmptyString
- Function name and signature: `testEmptyString()`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `reverse` method with empty string. It checks if the `reverse` method correctly handles empty strings.
- Input parameters and test data used: An empty string `s`.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The method should return an empty string.
- Any mocking or setup required: None.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is based on the actual test code. The test file is designed to cover different scenarios such as normal cases, edge cases, null handling, and empty string. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of the `reverse` method in the `ReverseString` class.

## Technical Details
- Required imports and their purposes: `import java.util.Stack;`
- Test framework being used: JUnit 5
- Any mock objects and why they're needed: None
- Test data and fixtures used: Normal cases, edge cases, null handling, and empty string.

## Running and Debugging
To run the tests, use the command `mvn test`. Prerequisites and environment setup: Ensure that the Maven project is set up correctly.

To debug failures, use the command `mvn test -Dtest=testName`. Replace `testName` with the name of the test you want to debug.

Common issues and solutions: Use the `mvn test -Dtest=testName` command to debug failures.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code structure is straightforward and follows the standard JUnit naming conventions. The tests are organized in a way that makes it easy to understand the functionality of the `reverse` method. The test file is well-structured and follows the JUnit best practices.

## Explanation
The `ReverseString` class has a `reverse` method that takes a string as input and returns the reversed string. The tests in this file cover different scenarios such as normal cases, edge cases, null handling, and empty string. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of the `reverse` method in the `ReverseString` class.
