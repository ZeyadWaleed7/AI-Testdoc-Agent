## Test File Documentation: test_ReverseString

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `ReverseString` class in the `ReverseString` package. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `reverseStringUsingStack` and `reverseStringUsingRecursion` methods of the `ReverseString` class are working correctly. The tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and error cases.

## Individual Test Functions

### Test Function 1: testReverseStringUsingStackWithNormalCases
- Function name and signature: `testReverseStringUsingStackWithNormalCases`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `reverseStringUsingStack` method by comparing the output of the method with the expected output.
- Input parameters and test data used: A string input and the expected output.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `assertEquals` method is used to assert that the actual output matches the expected output.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### Test Function 2: testReverseStringUsingStackWithEdgeCases
- Function name and signature: `testReverseStringUsingStackWithEdgeCases`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `reverseStringUsingStack` method by comparing the output of the method with the expected output. It also validates the edge cases such as null input, and large inputs.
- Input parameters and test data used: A string input and the expected output.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `assertEquals` method is used to assert that the actual output matches the expected output. The `assertThrows` method is used to assert that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when the input is null.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### Test Function 3: testReverseStringUsingStackWithNullInput
- Function name and signature: `testReverseStringUsingStackWithNullInput`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `reverseStringUsingStack` method by comparing the output of the method with the expected output. It also validates the edge case of null input.
- Input parameters and test data used: A null string input and the expected output.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `assertThrows` method is used to assert that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown when the input is null.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### Test Function 4: testReverseStringUsingRecursion
- Function name and signature: `testReverseStringUsingRecursion`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test function validates the `reverseStringUsingRecursion` method by comparing the output of the method with the expected output.
- Input parameters and test data used: A string input and the expected output.
- Expected outcomes and assertions: The `assertEquals` method is used to assert that the actual output matches the expected output.
- Any mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

## Test Strategy and Coverage

- Test patterns and best practices followed: The test patterns and best practices used in this test file are based on the JUnit framework.

## Explanation
The `ReverseString` class in the `ReverseString` package is designed to reverse a string. The `reverseStringUsingStack` method uses a `Stack` to reverse the string. The `reverseStringUsingRecursion` method uses recursion to reverse the string. The test file is designed to test these methods. The test file is written in Java and is run using Maven. The test file is designed to cover a wide range of scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and error cases. The tests are designed to validate the `reverseStringUsingStack` and `reverseStringUsingRecursion` methods of the `ReverseString` class. The tests are written in Java and are run using Maven. The test file is designed to test the functionality of the `ReverseString` class in the `ReverseString` package.
