## Test File Documentation: test_ReverseString

## Overview
The test file is designed to test the `ReverseString` class in the `ReverseString` package. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the `reverseString` method in the `ReverseString` class is functioning correctly. The tests cover different scenarios such as normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions.

## Individual Test Functions

### testReverseString_normalCases
- Function name and signature: `testReverseString_normalCases`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test validates the `reverseString` method by reversing a string.
- Input parameters: A string `input`
- Expected outcomes: The reversed string `expectedOutput`
- Assertions: The `assertEquals` method is used to assert that the reversed string is equal to `expectedOutput`.
- Mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testReverseString_edgeCases
- Function name and signature: `testReverseString_edgeCases`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test validates the `reverseString` method by handling edge cases such as an empty string and a single character string.
- Input parameters: An empty string `input` and a single character string `input`
- Expected outcomes: The reversed string `expectedOutput`
- Assertions: The `assertEquals` method is used to assert that the reversed string is equal to `expectedOutput`.
- Mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

### testReverseString_errorConditions
- Function name and signature: `testReverseString_errorConditions`
- Specific purpose and validation: This test validates the `reverseString` method by handling null input.
- Input parameters: A null `input`
- Expected outcomes: A `NullPointerException` is thrown
- Assertions: The `assertThrows` method is used to assert that a `NullPointerException` is thrown when the `reverseString` method is called with a null input.
- Mocking or setup required: No mocking is required for this test.

## Test Strategy and Coverage
The test strategy and coverage is designed to cover all possible scenarios. The tests are designed to handle normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions. The tests are designed to validate the `reverseString` method by reversing a string.

## Technical Details
- Required imports: `java.util.Stack`
- Test framework: `junit`
- Mock objects: No mock objects are needed for this test.
- Test data: No test data is used in this test.

## Running and Debugging
To run the tests, the command `mvn test` should be used. The prerequisites and environment setup is not specified in this test file. The tests are designed to be run in a Java environment with Maven installed.

## Code Structure Analysis
The code structure is well-organized. The tests are organized in a logical manner, with each test function representing a specific test case. The test functions are named according to their purpose and the input they validate. The test data is not used in this test file.

## Explanation
The `ReverseString` class in the `ReverseString` package is designed to reverse a string. The `reverseString` method takes a string as input and returns the reversed string.
